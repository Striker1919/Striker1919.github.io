Hello, my name is Marshall Rosenberg.

I'm very glad to have this opportunity to share with you,
in this program, some skills; and some consciousness, 
that have been extraordinarily helpful to me
in my life. I'm pleased to say that
thousands of people around the world
that I have shared it with find it
helpful to them, so 
I'm glad to share it with you through this program.

In this session, I'll be giving you an introduction to
how I came about the process that I'll be talking about
and I'll be sharing with you its purpose and give you an outline of it.
The process I call "Nonviolent Communication."
I don't like that title.
But why do I use it? 

Well, I use it because over the years it connects me
with the people around the world that
find our training very valuable in their
lives and in their political activities,
and so I have used it because it
connects me with those people.
but why I don't like the title-
One of the reasons is the same reason
that Gandhi didn't like the word
non-violent-
it says what something isn't. 
That non-violent communication is all focused
on what we do want not just what we don't want.
Also communication is only a small part
of what I'll be sharing with you.

Nonviolent communication consists of-

1. a value system that we are trying to live by 

2. outlines a language thinking communication skills

3. Means of influence that support that way of living.

What I'd like to do now is give you an
idea of how this process evolved...

I would trace its onset to my family
moving to Detroit in 1943, just in time
for the race riots.
My family moved into the center of where
these race riots took place.
This was quite an experience for me as a
young boy at the time.
It was an experience to sit in a house
locked in for four days, not able to go
out because of the violence in the
streets,
and to find out later that 30 people
were killed in our neighborhood in just
about a week.
This stayed with me that this is a world
where people might want to hurt you
because of your skin color.

And when I went to school, for the first
time in Detroit, Michigan,
I learned something else that was rather
frightening to me as a young boy.
I learned that my last name could be a
stimulus for violence.
First day, I was in class, when the
teacher read off the roll and said,
"Marshall Rosenberg" and I raised my hand,
two boys in front of me spun around and
one of them said, 

"Are you a "kike?"" 

I had never heard that word until then and I said, 

"what?" 

he said 

"Are you a Jew?"

and I said 

"yes."

And he and his friend were waiting for
me, after I left school that day, waiting
to beat me.

So this was another lesson that not only
is this a world where people might want
to harm you because of your skin color,
but some people hearing my name wanted
to hurt me.

This instilled in me questions about- 

"why is this?" 

"why do people want to hurt one another?"

Simply because of their name simply
because of their skin color.

At the same time,
I had another powerful learning
experience,
quite a different one than
to see the violence that was going on in
the streets.
I saw that violence isn't what we human
beings are really about.
I was fortunate enough to see
people exercising compassion under
difficult conditions.

For example, my grandmother, with whom we
lived,
was paralyzed.
And my mother was taking care of her.
And each night, one of my uncles would
come to help my mother
take care of my grandmother.
And I couldn't wait for him to get there.
and I would watch as he took care of my
grandmother, as he cleaned her up, gave
her various Medical Treatments, that she
needed-
what struck me is the whole time he was
doing this the beautiful smile on his
face.
Even though to me, as a boy, it seemed
that the work he was doing was not easy
and it was difficult to clean up
somebody and
give them medications. The whole time he
was doing it, he had such a beautiful
smile on his face.

So, I saw this aspect of human beings.

Human beings who could enjoy
contributing to other people's
well-being.

So, two questions were in me from this
time on and to this day.
Then these two questions are- 

"What happens to people to lead them to enjoy
other people's suffering and to make
them want to contribute to other
people's suffering?"

"What happens to us human beings
so that we stay with the process of
compassion where we enjoy contributing
to each other's well-being?" 

I wanted to learn about that.

I wanted to learn what contributes to
the violence, so I could do whatever I
could to transform it; to prevent it.
And I wanted to learn whatever I could
about what helps human beings to stay
connected to, what I believe is, our
nature; our compassionate nature.
And I wanted to do whatever I could to
live that way myself and to distribute
what I learned to others.
